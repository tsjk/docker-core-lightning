#     Empty value implies default setting.
#     Default:
#       3600:3758096384:false::${NETWORK_DATA_DIRECTORY}
#     Meaning, check every hour whether gossip_store in
#     ${NETWORK_DATA_DIRECTORY} exceeds 3758096384B, and print warning if it
#     does (i.e. do not restart Core Lightning). Since path to file that
#     signals disabling of restarts is empty, the file is not checked for (and
#     since restarts are disabled as default the file would have no effect).
#     Check time of zero disables GOSSIP_STORE_WATCHER completely.
#     This is only needed for Core Lightning versions 24.02.* - 24.08.*
